Option 3: The Hierarchical Agent (Recursive Delegation)

This architecture directly addresses the "bottom-up" approach by having the agents operate in a hierarchical, recursive manner.

How it works:

A top-level agent is given the command "document the entire repository."

This agent inspects the repository's root directory and identifies all immediate files and subfolders.

For each file, it delegates to a Documenter agent to generate documentation.

For each subfolder, it recursively calls a new instance of itself to document that subfolder.

When a sub-agent finishes documenting its subfolder (by combining the documentation of its sub-files and sub-folders), it returns the result to its parent agent.

The top-level agent then combines the documentation from all top-level files and the results from its sub-agents to create the final repository-wide documentation.

Pros: Intuitively matches a file system's structure, making the final documentation well-organized. It is also highly parallelizable as sub-agents can work independently.

Cons: The most complex to implement and debug due to the recursive nature of the calls. It requires careful state management to avoid infinite loops or re-documenting the same files.
