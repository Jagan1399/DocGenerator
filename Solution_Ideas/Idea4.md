Option 1: The Orchestrator Agent (Centralized Control)

This is a classic top-down, command-and-control architecture. A single "Orchestrator" agent is responsible for the entire workflow.

How it works:

The Orchestrator agent starts by using a file system tool to get a list of all relevant code files in the repository.

It then loops through this list, delegating a sub-task for each file to a specialized "Documenter" tool.

The Documenter tool reads the content of a single file and uses an LLM to generate documentation in a structured format (e.g., Markdown or JSON).

The Orchestrator collects all these individual documentation files and stores them in a temporary location.

Once all files are processed, the Orchestrator performs a final step of combining these individual documentation chunks into a single, cohesive document for the entire repository.

Pros: Easy to understand and implement. The state is centrally managed by a single agent, which makes debugging straightforward.

Cons: Can be inefficient for very large repositories. If the Orchestrator's context window is exceeded, it may lose track of which files it has already processed, leading to redundant work or missed files.
