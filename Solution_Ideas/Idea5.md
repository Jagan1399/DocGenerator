Option 2: The Stateful Agent (Memory Bank)

This architecture is more robust and scalable, utilizing a persistent storage mechanism to manage the state of the documentation process.

How it works:

The agent maintains a persistent Memory Bank, which can be a simple database or a dedicated state management service.

The agent starts by getting a list of all files in the repo.

For each file, it first checks the Memory Bank to see if it has already been documented. If it has, it skips it.

If not, it calls a Documentation tool to generate the documentation for that file.

It then writes the generated documentation and a flag indicating the file is "done" into the Memory Bank.

The agent can then use the contents of the Memory Bank to create a new, high-level document. This final step can be triggered manually or once all files have been processed.

Pros: Highly scalable and fault-tolerant. The process can be paused and resumed without losing progress. It's more memory-efficient as the agent doesn't need to hold the entire file list in its working memory.

Cons: More complex to set up due to the need for a separate database or state management service.
