Multi-Pass Pipeline Architecture
Core Design:

Pass 1: File discovery and metadata collection
Pass 2: Syntax analysis and structure extraction
Pass 3: Cross-reference resolution and relationship mapping
Pass 4: Documentation generation and linking

Key Components:

File Scanner: Discovers all code files and categorizes by type
Parser Factory: Language-specific parsers for different file types
Symbol Table Manager: Tracks functions, classes, variables across files
Cross-Reference Engine: Builds relationships between code elements
Documentation Generator: Creates structured docs with internal links

Pros: Highly systematic, excellent for cross-referencing, easily parallelizable
Cons: Multiple passes can be resource-intensive, complex state management
